+++

The [Oxford RobotCycle Project](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/projects/robotcycle/) is a novel initiative aiming to understand how road and traffic infrastructure influence road users’ behaviour, affecting cyclists’ journeys and safety.
By leveraging state- of-the-art technology and methods used in Autonomous Vehicles (AVs), this project introduces a novel multimodal dataset, capturing dynamic cycling data in complex and diverse urban traffic environments.

Here above is the backpack used for recording the dataset.

This work has now produced a workshop and a [conference](/publications/20240602-robotcycle-iv) paper.
The first one was presented at the [Workshop on Field Robotics](https://norlab-ulaval.github.io/workshop_field_robotics_icra2024/) at ICRA 2024, and the second at the IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV) 2024.

The dataset is still under construction and will be available roughly in mid 2025.
