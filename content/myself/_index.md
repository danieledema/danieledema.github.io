I am a Departmental Lecturer in Mobile Robotics at the [Oxford Robotics Institute (ORI)](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/) where I co-lead the [Mobile Robotics Group (MRG)](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/labs/mobile-robotics-group/) with [Professor Paul Newman](https://ori.ox.ac.uk/people/paul-newman/).
I am also a [College Lecturer](https://www.pmb.ox.ac.uk/person/dr-daniele-de-martini) in Engineering Science at Pembroke College.

I have a passion for cyber-physical systems, among which robots shine, and love working on making robots autonomously operate from the ground up.
In doing so, I believe more and more that learning and adaptation is paramount for robot autonomy.
I hope that my work will enable robots to be widely adopted in a variety of applications, from industrial and business to domestic environments, helping the people in their day-to-day tasks.

I joined MRG as a Postdoctoral Research Assistant in 2018 after a DPhil in Engineering Science at the [Università degli Studi di Pavia](http://www-3.unipv.it/ingserv/en/index.php) under the supervision of [Prof. Tullio Facchinetti](https://robot.unipv.it/toolleeo/).
During my doctorate studies, I investigated the application of real-time sscheduling algorithms to energy management of electromechanical devices with the goal of reducing the power consumption.
Before that, I had my BSc at the Università degli Studi di Pavia and my MSc at the Politecnico di Torino where I studied Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering respectively.
