### Abstract
This paper is about reducing the power consumption of Cyber–Physical Energy Systems (CPESs) composed of many loads through the usage of a scheduling technique inspired by the real-time-computing domain; the electric-load coordination guarantees a more efficient operation of the entire system by avoiding unnecessary concurrent activation of loads and thus limiting the peak load. We represent the power loads themselves as “physical” components and the computing devices that coordinate them as “cyber” components and formally derive the relationship between the operations in cyber and physical domains as the interplay between the schedules enforced on each component: indeed, the schedule of the loads – generated by combining a two-dimensional bin-packing and an optimal multi-processor real-time scheduling algorithm – influences the timing of the processing tasks that are dedicated to the activation/deactivation of loads themselves. We also consider non-schedulable loads by introducing a policy to cope with the presence of such loads. Numerical simulations and experiments confirm the good performance of the proposed peak load reduction method. The usage of real-time scheduling in this context provides inherent resource optimisation by limiting the number of concurrent loads that are active at the same time, thus directly reducing the overall peak load; moreover, thanks to the limited computational complexity of the algorithms, it scales to large systems, overcoming the scalability issues of common optimisation methods. Numerical simulations and experiments confirm the good performance of the proposed peak load reduction method.
