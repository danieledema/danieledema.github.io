### Abstract

Fuzzy logic is a powerful modelling approach to build control applications and to generate knowledge-based evaluation indices. In both cases, however, the applicability to complex systems is limited by the difficulty of defining the fuzzy rules and membership functions. This paper presents a framework for the automatic generation of fuzzy evaluation systems for embedded applications. The framework is based on the F-IND (Fuzzy INDices) methodology, which allows the automatic generation of fuzzy rules and membership functions from data. The framework provides a configuration-based approach that simplifies the development of fuzzy evaluation systems and makes them suitable for embedded applications with limited computational resources. The effectiveness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through a case study in environmental monitoring.
