### Abstract

The increasing spreading of robotics applications requires the formation of more and more experts with knowledge in core aspects of robotics systems. This paper introduces eduMorse, a novel framework for the education in the scope of mobile robotics. The framework addresses the accurate simulation of single- and multi-robot systems, with special focus on the possibility to implement path planning, navigation and control strategies, to handle sensors and actuators, and the communication among robots, thus allowing for the simulation of multi-robot coordination strategies. eduMorse is built on top of the open-source MORSE simulator and leverages open-source tools to build a modular client-server framework for the simulation of mobile robots. The paper describes the components of eduMorse and its architecture. An example of application is also presented to show the effectiveness of the robotics simulation and the usage workflow of the system.
