I am a Postdoctoral Research Assistant (PDRA) at the University of Oxford and a Junior Research Fellow at Kellogg College. I work with Prof. Paul Newman in the Mobile Robotics Group (MRG), part of the Oxford Robotics Institute (ORI).

I joined MRG after a DPhil in Engineering Science at the Università degli Studi di Pavia under the supervision of Prof. Tullio Facchinetti. During my doctorate studies, I investigated the application of real-time sscheduling algorithms to energy management of electromechanical devices with the goal of reducing the power consumption.

Before that, I had my BSc at the Università degli Studi di Pavia and my MSc at the Politecnico di Torino where I studied Mechanical and Mechatronics Engineering respectively.

I have a passion for cyber-physical systems, among which robots shine, and love working on making robots autonomously operate from the ground up. In doing so, I am more and more involved in the machine-learning field and believe that learning and adaptation is paramount for robot autonomy.

I hope that my work will enable robots to be widely adopted in a variety of applications, from industrial and business to domestic environments, helping the people in their day-to-day tasks.
