### Abstract
This article addresses the application of real-time scheduling to the reduction of the peak load of power consumption generated by electric loads in Cyber-Physical Energy Systems (CPES).
The goal is to reduce the peak load while achieving a desired Quality of Service of the physical system under control.
The considered physical processes are characterized by integrator dynamics and modelled as sporadic real-time activities.
Timing constraints are obtained from physical parameters and are used to manage the activation of electric loads by a real-time scheduling algorithm.
As a main contribution, an algorithm derived from the multi-processor real-time scheduling domain is proposed to efficiently deal with a high number of physical processes (i.e., electric loads), making its scalability suitable for large CPES, such as smart energy grids.
The cyber-physical nature of the proposed method arises from the tight interaction between the physical processes operated by the electric loads, and the applied scheduling.
