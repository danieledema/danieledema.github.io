### Abstract

This work presents the solutions adopted for the design and the implementation of an autonomous wheeled robot developed for the exploration and mapping of air ventilation ducts. The hardware is based on commercial off-the-shelf devices, including sensors, motors, processing devices and interfaces. The mechanical chassis was designed from scratch to meet a trade-off between small size and robustness. The robot is equipped with a laser range finder for mapping and obstacle avoidance, an inertial measurement unit for localization, and a camera for visual inspection. The software architecture is based on the Robot Operating System (ROS) and implements simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms for autonomous navigation in the duct environment. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design in exploring and mapping air ventilation ducts.
